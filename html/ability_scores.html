        <p>If this rule is in use, players may only take Feats at levels where they normally get an ASI. Ability Scores can only be improved by successfully performing skill checks with their respective Ability Score. An Ability score goes up to a new Ability score when you've rolled, on the d20, the Ability score above your current score or higher and successfully surpassed the DC as many times as the Ability score above your current Ability score. E.G.  your current Strength score is 9. To get to 10, you must, on 10 separate strength related rolls, pass the DC and roll a 10 or higher on the d20. Strength-related rolls means all rolls that use strength, whether they are an ability check, a saving throw, or a skill check.</p>

<h2 class="anchor-sub" id="intelligence-proficiencies">Proficiencies</h2>
    <p>During character creation, you may choose additional proficiences equal to Your Intelligence modifier. Choose between a language, a tool proficiency, or a skill proficiency.</p>
<h1 class="anchor" id="constitution">Constitution</h1>
<h2 class="anchor-sub" id="constitution-sprint">Sprint</h2>
    <p>A character can expend their Action, Bonus Action, and Movement to move their Movement Speed times 4. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (a minimum of one). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. E.G. I’m a wood elf with 35 feet of movement and I declare I’m going to use <dfn>Sprint</dfn> this turn, so I move 35 x 4 feet, which equals 140 feet.</p>
