<h1 class="anchor" id="climb-swim-crawl">Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling</h1>
<h2 style="padding-top: 10px;" class="anchor-sub" id="climb-swim-crawl-climbing">Climbing</h2>
    <h3>Rules as Written</h3>
    <p>Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) when you're climbing. You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing speed and use it to climb.</p>
    <h3>Difficulty Class</h3>
        <p>The DC of climbing (Athletics check) is determined by two factors: (1) The distance one must climb and (2) whether the climbing surface is considered <i>Difficult Terrain</i>. If the climbing surface is difficult terrain, simply add 4 to the DC. The DC is not to exceed 30. Refer to the table at the bottom for Difficulty Classes by Distance.</p>
    <h3>Failing the Climbing Check</h3>
        <p>If a character fails the check, the character climbs the intended distance, then they fall, resulting in the need to roll for fall damage.</p>
<h2 class="anchor-sub" id="climb-swim-crawl-swimming">Swimming</h2>
    <h3>Rules as Written</h3>
        <p>Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain) when you're swimming. You ignore this extra cost if you have a swimming speed and use it to swim.</p>
    <h3>Difficulty Class</h3>
        <p>The DC of swimming (Athletics check) is only applied when in rough water (non-difficult terrain) and turbulant water (difficult terrain). Calm water does not have a DC attached to successfully swimming. The DC is determined by two factors: (1) The distance one swims and (2) whether the swimming surface is considered <i>Difficult Terrain</i>. If the swimming surface is difficult terrain, simply add 4 to the DC. The DC is not to exceed 30. Refer to the table at the bottom for Difficulty Classes by Distance.</p>
    <h3>Failing the Swimming Check</h3>
        <p>If a character fails the check, the character swims half way and is then swept the rest of their movement in the direction of the current (minimum 5 feet). This direction could be underwater or along the surface down a river. The character must then make a Constitution saving throw equal to the swimming DC. On a fail, the character takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 for every 5ft moved and falls prone. On a success, the damage is halved. E.G. if the character is swept 15 feet and fails the Con. save, the character takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is subject to the prone condition.</p>

<h2 class="anchor-sub" id="traveling-riding-horses">Riding Horses</h2>
    <p>Horses are unique in that they cannot run at their full speed constantly. As such, reference the below table to determine the PCs' speeds when they travel on riding horses. Should a PC want to gallop on a horse for travel, a horse's galloping speed is 15 mph, which can be sustained for 1 hour. Attempting to gallop on a single horse for 2 hours or more requires the horse to push itself beyond its limits. As such, at the end of each hour, starting at the end of the 2nd hour, the horse that is being ridden must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. On a fail, the horse dies. On a success, the horse can go on for one more hour.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Pushing your horses beyond the period length pushes them beyond their physical limits requiring each horse that has been ridden within the current 8-hour period to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a fail, the horse dies. On a success, the horse can travel for another hour. E.G. if I have 2 horses and have travelled for 8 hours, but want to keep travelling on the same horses, then every hour I must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw for each horse. On a fail, the horse dies. On a succes, I can push another hour if I so choose.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You'll notice that in the below table, if one has enough horses, one can travel for 24 hours continuously. If a PC elects to travel on a horse for 17 or more hours in a single day, the PC will not gain the benefits of a long rest that day.</p>
