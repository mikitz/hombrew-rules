<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>This is the collection of my hombrew rules that I use for D&D 5e. Along with the rules, some of them have a calculator or a roller to make it easier to implement in-game. I tried my best to categorize them, but if you have any feedback, just message me on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mikitz">Reddit</a>. I'm especially interested in your feedback related to the wording. I want to make the explanations as clear as possible.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>Mikitz</p>
